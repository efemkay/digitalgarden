## Personal Summary

## Summary by Chapter
- Many children with mild forms of ASDs including those in the past diagnosed as having Pervasive Developmental Disorders not otherwise specified (NOS) and high functioning (HF) Asperger Syndrome (AS) have positive outcomes and develop abilities that allow integrated functioning in school and workplace settings.  The majority of these children, however, continue to display residual signs
- #### There’s 40-50% likelihood for the third child if the second child is autistic  
	- Genetic prognostic information is difficult to provide due to the wide spectrum of diagnosis. When a broad inclusion is used for children with a diagnosis of an idiopathic ASD there may be a 20-30% risk of having a second child after the first child is diagnosed. If a second child is diagnosed then the risk may increase to 40-50% for the third child.
