- #### Lead-in style or action title is a concise summary of the slide’s main statement in one sentence.
	- The title should be a proper sentence that communicates the summary of the slide well, highlighting only the 1 (or at most 2) key information – which can either be an insights/findings or action required. This is similar to how a permanent or evergreen notes should [[Areas/Public/Prefer Note Titles with Complete Phrase\|Prefer Note Titles with Complete Phrase]]
	- If you want to, you can still add a subheading that describes the slide’s exact content for added clarity. But this should at different line and has different font style (that is consistent as a subtitle)
- #### You write in lead-in style to ensure the message is clear from the beginning and the slide content act as a supporting materials to the title
	- In business setting, this is important to ensure the key message get across quickly and avoid overextending presentation more than necessary
	- It also forces you to plan the presentation from outcome-based perspective as you already has an outcome in mind (e.g. findings you want to highlights or actions you want the management to do)
