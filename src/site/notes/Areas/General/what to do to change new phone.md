- ### Preparation (prior to swapping SIM card)
	- #### Ensure any app with sync feature is enabled and if required, do a manual sync push
		- Backup using Samsung account on general settings of the phone – this is not mandatory but will help transition easier
	- #### Sync/back up the authenticator app
		- In my case, I use Microsoft Authenticator. I need to ensure I’m signed Microsoft account and enable the sync
		- This step is important especially if you have any account that rely on MFA
- ### Prior to swapping the SIM card
	- #### Migrate the **local** phone’s content from the old one to the new one
		- If the new phone is a Samsung, it’s best to use Samsung Smart Switch app
	- #### Backup the WhatsApp app to the cloud for recovery later on the new phone
		- This need to be done on the old phone **prior to swapping the SIM**
		- It’s important to do this last as any messages that comes in after backup and reactivating on the new one (with SIM swapping) will not be transferred
- ### After swapping the SIM card
	- #### Activate the WhatsApp app
		- It’s important to do this first to minimise lost messages (that won’t be transferred to new phone)
	- #### Reactivate the banking apps
		- This need to be done after swapping the SIM card since some will require SMS authentication
