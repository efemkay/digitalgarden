My insightful notes are primarily on [[Areas/MOCs/00 Engineering Economics\|00 Engineering Economics]] and [[Areas/MOCs/00 Petroleum Engineering\|00 Petroleum Engineering]]. But I also dabbled on [[Areas/MOCs/00 Statistics\|00 Statistics]] and [[Areas/MOCs/00 Coding\|00 Coding]] as I expand my initiatives towards big data and PKM. Follow the feed below, or simply use the search ;)

If you want to understand further how I structure my notes, I lay it out in [[Areas/General/About My Notes\|About My Notes]] . Btw, this digital garden is using [oleeskild/obsidian-digital-garden (github.com)](https://github.com/oleeskild/obsidian-digital-garden) with quite a number of my personal tweaks.
