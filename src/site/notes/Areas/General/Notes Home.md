<span class="epsilon">ε</span>femkay

Hey there! This is my digital garden – a lifelong learning notes to help with my career and hobby. My insightful notes are primarily on [[Areas/MOCs/00 Engineering Economics\|00 Engineering Economics]] and [[Areas/MOCs/00 Petroleum Engineering\|00 Petroleum Engineering]]. But I also dabbled on [[Areas/MOCs/00 Statistics\|00 Statistics]] and [[Areas/MOCs/00 Coding\|00 Coding]] as I expand my initiatives towards big data and PKM. Below is my top MOC but there a few more (which you can browse via the hamburger menu). If you’re looking for something specific it might be easier to simply use the search (top right corner)
- [[Areas/MOCs/00 Engineering Economics\|00 Engineering Economics]] #mcl/list-card
- [[Areas/MOCs/00 Petroleum Engineering\|00 Petroleum Engineering]]
- [[Areas/MOCs/00 Productivity\|00 Productivity]]
- [[Areas/MOCs/00 Statistics\|00 Statistics]]
- [[Areas/MOCs/00 Investing\|00 Investing]]

If you want to understand further how I structure my notes, including how I publish this, I lay it out in [[Areas/General/About My Notes\|About My Notes]] . Btw, this digital garden is using [oleeskild/obsidian-digital-garden (github.com)](https://github.com/oleeskild/obsidian-digital-garden) with quite a number of my personal tweaks.

If you want to know what are my latest notes, table below shows the recently updated and recently added notes.
