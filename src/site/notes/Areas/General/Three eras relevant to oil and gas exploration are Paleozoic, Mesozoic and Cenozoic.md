- #### The most relevant eras in oil and gas falls under the Phanerozoic eon which consists of the Paleozoic, Mesozoic and Cenozoic eras

- #### The geological periods that are particularly relevant to oil and gas exploration are the Mesozoic and Paleozoic Eras, which span from approximately 60 to 600 million years ago,
	- These eras hold immense importance for petroleum geologists as almost all of the discovered oil and gas reserves are contained within rocks from these time periods
	- The Mesozoic era, known as the "age of the dinosaurs," is especially significant for exploration due to the presence of oil and gas produced during this time
