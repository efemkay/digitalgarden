Browser based apps has becoming a norm and this trend has been so for many years already. It’s not just simple email client or messaging app. You already have full Photoshop in the browser, video editor, and even full office suite (spreadsheet, presentation and so on).

This Outside the Fox interview has a good discussion about this and the trend. See [Are browser apps the future of software? | Outside the Fox](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzxVlaIM8mQ)

### Photos and Diagramming
- #### Photopea (Online Photo Editor)
	- https://www.photopea.com/
	- Based on some YT users and blogposts I come across, many seems to prefer this for advanced image editing. Even when compared to GIMP.
	- For me, I’ve only used to edit and draw svg because I wanted to create a logo and edit icons for my Obsidian. See also [[Areas/General/convert svg to data uri\|convert svg to data uri]]
- #### draw.io OR diagrams.net
	- https://app.diagrams.net/ for the app and https://www.drawio.com for the website
	- This is my favourite tool diagramming and it has both online and desktop (offline) app. For me,this app is more proper with ability to do flowcharts, professional level process flow with swimlane and influence diagram.
	- It complements this with some ability to “sketch” basic diagrams for note taking and brainstorming. The freehand function is a bit limited especially when compared to Excalidraw.
- #### Excalidraw
	- https://excalidraw.com/
	- It has better support for freehand drawings but it still complements well on its basic diagramming for drawing flowcharts and perhaps facilitating brainstorming sessions

### Other Tools
- #### Area Calculator https://www.mapdevelopers.com/area_finder.php
	- Outline a property on a google map and find its area. Will give you area in all units

I have a separate note on AI tools to summarise YouTube videos. See [[Areas/General/AI tools for youtube\|AI tools for youtube]]
