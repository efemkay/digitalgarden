- ### Estate Planning Providers
	- If you’re comparing **true alternatives**, the main independent corporate trustees are still **As-Salihin, Wasiyyah Shoppe, and Amanah Raya**.
		- The others (RHB, Bank Muamalat, Kausar) are essentially **distribution or agency partners** of those three. For a RM5–7 million estate like yours, the real choice boils down to:
	- **Cost efficiency** → Wasiyyah Shoppe
	- **Institutional credibility** → As-Salihin
	- **Government backing** → Amanah Raya

## Cases
- #### _Hibah_ management in older plans that existed before IFSA 2013 used the concept of _wasi_ (trustee), not absolute ownership-based _hibah_.
	- “That’s why there was confusion in the past… it was not clearly stated whether the gift to heirs was through _hibah_ or _wasi_. Today, it’s clear. In current takaful plans, conditional _hibah_ is valid and legally grounded,” she said, adding that _hibah_ nominations are valid and cannot be contested unless there is an element of fraud or breach of contract.
