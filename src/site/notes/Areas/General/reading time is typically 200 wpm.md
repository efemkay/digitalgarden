- #### Average reading time based on 2017 study is about 200 words per minute and it is measured based on talk time (for when you’re presenting or delivering speeches)
	- The default “talk time” estimate is based on an oral reading rate of **183 wpm**; which is considered to be the accepted average for adults according to scientific research `Hasbrouck, J. & Tindal, G. (2017)`
	- **Silent Reading Time** is estimated based on a fixed reading speed of _**238 words per minute**_.
- #### Another paper published by Marc Brysbaert further supports the ~200wpm average speed where the 77 studies for reading aloud is estimated to be 183 wpm for adults
	- This value is based on 77 studies involving 5965 participants. The paper further states that reading rates are lower for older adults, children and readers with English as a second language.
	- Author of “How to Write Short_._”, Roy Peter Clark, estimates that his readers average reading speed at about 200 wpm. But noted that readers might not be as interested as you wish.
	- In one London study, for instance, employees spent only about two minutes reading their own CEO’s message. The longest message — Lloyd’s of London’s, at 872 words — got less reading time than the shorter two, from GE and Heinz, at about half that length.
- #### Reading Material Matters – It’s essential to note that reading speeds may vary depending on the material
	- For instance, fiction books and light content can be read faster than non-fiction or technical material, which often requires more in-depth comprehension.
