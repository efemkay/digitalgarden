- #### Bayes’ theorem teaches us to include our prior (known information) before jumping to conclusions (posterior probability) and this is the basis for Bayesian Thinking
	- one can think of prior as knowledge or context while posterior probability is the revised or updated probability of the outcome
	- this is also the premise of [[Areas/General/we can test resources dependency with conditional or joint probability\|we can test resources dependency with conditional or joint probability]]
- #### Chong Han Khai in “Bayesian Thinking in Everyday Life” post argues that Bayesian Thinking can be applied to improve rational decision-making in daily life focusing on three key areas
	- **Remember Your Priors**: It’s important to consider your existing beliefs and knowledge (priors) when evaluating new information. This helps in making more informed decisions.
	- **Think of the Counterfactuals**: When assessing a situation, consider alternative scenarios or outcomes that could have occurred. This helps in understanding the full context and potential biases.
	- **Don’t Stick to Your Priors Forever**: While priors are useful, it’s crucial to update them with new evidence. Being flexible and willing to change your beliefs based on new information leads to better decision-making.
