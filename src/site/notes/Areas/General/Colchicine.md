- Colchicine is a well-established medication specifically used to **treat and prevent gout attacks**.
- It works by reducing the inflammation caused by uric acid crystals in the joints. It's most effective when taken at the first sign of a gout flare.
- It can also be prescribed at a lower dose for long-term prevention of gout attacks.
