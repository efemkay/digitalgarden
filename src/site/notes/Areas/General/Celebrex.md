**Celebrex Cap 200mg (Celecoxib):**
- Celebrex is also an **NSAID**, but it belongs to a specific subgroup called **selective COX-2 inhibitors**. 
	- Like other NSAIDs, it reduces pain and inflammation. However, it selectively targets the COX-2 enzyme, which is primarily involved in inflammation, while having less effect on the COX-1 enzyme, which plays a role in protecting the stomach lining.
	- This selectivity was initially thought to lead to fewer gastrointestinal side effects compared to non-selective NSAIDs like naproxen, although cardiovascular risks are still a consideration. Celebrex is also used to **treat acute pain and inflammation**, including gout flares.
- Another NSAID is [[Areas/MOCs/Naproxen Sodium\|Naproxen Sodium]]
