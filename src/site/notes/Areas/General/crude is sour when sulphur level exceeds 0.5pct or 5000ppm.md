- #### Typically, a crude is defined as "sour" if its sulfur content exceeds 0.5%, or if it does not meet the required thresholds for hydrogen sulfide and carbon dioxide levels.
	- The percentage is measured by weight (i.e. wt%). [New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nymex.asp) define the threshold a bit tighter at 0.42%.
	- Because the percentage is a wt%, it can easily converted/compared to ppm (which is the more common unit in technical data reports), one only need to multiply the value in percent by **10,000**. 
		- i.e. $S_\text{ppm} = S_\text{wt\%} \times 10,000$
			- see [Percent (%) to ppm conversion calculator | number conversion (rapidtables.com)](https://www.rapidtables.com/convert/number/Percent_to_PPM.html)
			- So, for 0.5% (wt%) the equivalent ppm is **5,000 ppm** of sulphur.

- #### This distinction between sour and sweet crude is important because it affects the cost of refining the oil.
	- In turn, this makes the more costly sour crude less efficient as a source of energy production, decreasing its demand from commodity investors. In an effort to reduce their total processing costs, sour crude producers often seek to refine sour crude into heavy oil products such as diesel and fuel oil (as opposed to gasoline).
- #### For shipping industry, the new acceptable sulphur limit for fuel is now moving towards 0.5% (from previously 3.5%)
	- see [[Areas/General/Bunkering\|Bunkering]]
	- LSFO now targeting below 1% with VLSFO requiring below 0.5%
