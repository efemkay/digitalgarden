Vanilla Obsidian only supports two (2) state of markdown checkboxes i.e. `todo / [ ]` and `done / [x]`. Listive provides additional checkboxes support with four (4) for tasks related and six (6) for info/highlights related as per screenshot below. Color schemeÂ of the icon (and background) follows the default Obsidian Callout colors.

By default the colorful background is enabled for info/highlights related alternate checkboxes. To change the disable it you need to have Style Settings plugin installed and enabled.
- Open `Style Settings`
- Go to `Listive Theme Settings > Content Elements Look and Feel > Alternate Checkboxes` and toggle the `Background Option` selection
