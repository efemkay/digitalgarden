- #### Non-coating pan is better for your heath as it doesn’t have materials that can be carcinogenic
	- it will likely to sticks sometimes when you cook, but that can be mitigated with some seasoning – wash it with soap and then spray/coat it with some oil
	- this also means you can use it with metal tools
- #### Non-coating can holds high temperature and cooks well for asian foods that require high temperature
	- this can be cast iron or stainless steel
	- this also means it can be used in the oven
