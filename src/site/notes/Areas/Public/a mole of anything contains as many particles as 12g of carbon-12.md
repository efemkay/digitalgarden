- #### A mole of anything, then, contains as many particles as there are in 12 g of carbon 12.
	- In other words, a mole is the ==number of atoms in exactly 12 g of carbon-12==. As such a mole is a way of counting things. We now know that one mole contains $6.02214129 \times 10^{23} \text{ particles}$
- #### Since it represents number of particles, the mass of the particular atom type will be the key differentiating factor
	- E.g. an oxygen atom has a mass of ¹⁶/₁₂ times that of a carbon-12 atom. As such if we want to have 1 mole of oxygen (O), we need to have 16 g of O atoms – then the two would had the same number of atoms (a mole of each).

> In the early 1800s, scientists realized that atoms and molecules react with each other in whole number ratios. That is one atom of something would react with 1 atom or 2 atoms or 3 atoms of something else, but never with, say, 1.33 atoms.

> They needed some way to count these atoms and/or molecules when they measured them out for their reactions.

> Eventually, they figured out the relative masses of atoms. They knew, for example, that an atom of oxygen has sixteen times the mass of a hydrogen atom.
> 
> Thus, if they measured out 1 g of H atoms and 16 g of O atoms, they knew they had the same number of atoms of each. But they didn’t know what that number was.

> During the 1960s, chemists agreed to use exactly 12 g of carbon-12 as their standard.
