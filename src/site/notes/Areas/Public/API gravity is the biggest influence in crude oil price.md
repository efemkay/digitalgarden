- #### There are 3 common aspects that influence crude oil prices i.e. API gravity, sulphur content and key contaminants (e.g. CO2 and Mercury)
	- see [[Areas/Engineering Economics/crude yield and api\|crude yield and api]]
	- Usually, crude oil is divided into 3 main categories depending on its API gravity:
		- Light Oil – API > 31
		- Medium Oil – API between 22 and 31
		- Heavy Oil – API < 22
		- For example, Brent crude oil has an API gravity of 38 and WTI has an API of 40.
		- This means that WTI is slightly lighter than Brent. However, both Brent and WTI fall into the light oil category.
	- sulphur content is the basis for classifying a crude’s sweetness – with lower sulphur being more sweet and higher sulphur more sour
		- anecdotally, this naming is based on how the “taste” of sulphur being sour in nature.
- #### When crude are refined in downstream, their monetisation attractiveness now depends on the end product and that product’s yield in open market
	- see [[Product yield is key to determine GPW\|Product yield is key to determine GPW]]
	- among the key product in the downstream are petroleum gas, fuel (gasoline/diesel), naptha and residue

## Knowing key crude type that’s used as global benchmark
- ### Brent is a light sweet crude oil produced in the North Sea.

	- Brent plays a uniquely important role in the global oil industry by acting as a [benchmark](https://www.mckinseyenergyinsights.com/resources/refinery-reference-desk/benchmark-price/ "Benchmark (price)") crude against which most other crude grades are priced.
	- **Quality:** – [API](https://www.mckinseyenergyinsights.com/resources/refinery-reference-desk/api-gravity/ "API gravity"): 37.5 / [Sulfur](https://www.mckinseyenergyinsights.com/resources/refinery-reference-desk/sulfur-content/ "Sulfur"): 0.40%
		- It contains approximately 0.37% of [sulphur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulphur "Sulphur"), classifying it as [sweet crude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweet_crude "Sweet crude"), yet not as sweet as WTI. Brent is suitable for production of [petrol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petrol "Petrol") and [middle distillates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_distillate "Middle distillate"). It is typically refined in Northwest Europe.
		- Brent Crude has a density of approximately 835 kg/m3, being equivalent to a [specific gravity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specific_gravity "Specific gravity") of 0.835 or an [API gravity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API_gravity "API gravity") of 38.06.
