- #### McKelvey’s Box is a simple device/diagram for visualizing categories of oil and mineral reserves and resources that shows level of uncertainty and risk
	- The original McKelvey box (with SPE-AAPG-WPC terminology) shows basic terminology with simple uncertainty grouping

	- The updated/modern (updated by a joint working group of the SPE, AAPG and WPC), reoqrganized and subdivided by probabilistic uncertainties (i.e. 1P, 2P, 3P)

- #### It was developed to avoid ambiguity in communication (in reporting of natural resources) and contains the following basic idea
	- only discovered, commercially-viable deposits get to be called **Reserves**.
	- Discovered but sub-commercial (with today's technology and pricing) are **contingent resources**.
	- Potentially producible and viable deposits that we've not yet found are called **prospective resources**. These are important distinctions, especially if you are a public company or a government.
