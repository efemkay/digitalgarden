- #### A Barrel of Oil Equivalent (BOE) is a unit of measurement used to compare different forms of energy and it represents the amount of energy that can be obtained from one barrel of oil
	- This unit is used to compare different types of energy sources, such as oil, natural gas, coal, and renewables, by converting them into a standard unit of measurement.
		- For example, if a natural gas field produces 6 million cubic feet of gas per day, this can be converted into BOE to compare it to the production of an oil field.
	- Inversely, there is also cubic feet of natural gas equivalent (CFE) for gas equivalent of energy.
- #### Conversion factor used for BOE is based on the energy content of a barrel of oil, which is typically 5.8 million British thermal units (BTUs) but it usually varies
	- For 5.8 million British Thermal Unit (MMBtu) basis, this means that one BOE is equivalent to the amount of energy that can be obtained from burning 5.8 MMBtu of oil
	- Common industry gas conversion factors usually range between 5.6 to 6.0 mscf per boe
		- mscf is thousand cubic feet and in this example, it assumes 1000 btu per scf (see [[Areas/General/boe to mmbtu\|boe to mmbtu]])
	- see also [[Areas/Petroleum Engineering/Ln slope parity with oil depends on ghv to boe factor\|Ln slope parity with oil depends on ghv to boe factor]]

> [!info] Calculating Barrel of Oil Equivalents
> The energy contained in a barrel of oil is approximately 5.8 million British thermal units (MBtus) or 1,700 kilowatt-hours (kWh) of energy. This is an approximate measure because different grades of oil have slightly different energy equivalents.
> 
> There are 42 gallons (approximately 159 liters) in one barrel of oil.

> A Barrel of Oil Equivalent (BOE) is a unit of measurement used to compare different forms of energy. It represents the amount of energy that can be obtained from one barrel of crude oil, typically measured in barrels of oil equivalent (BOE) or cubic feet of natural gas equivalent (CFE).

By encompassing different types of energy resources into one figure, analysts, investors, and management can assess the total amount of energy the firm can access. This is also known as crude oil equivalent (COE).
