- #### Ln slope (in %) has theoretical ceiling of about 16-17% as this is the “deemed energy” that is parity to oil
	- The 16-17% limit assumes 1000btu per scf. In real world, this can range from 900 to 1200. Due to this, SPE definition has a range of 5600scf to 6000scf per boe
		- As such, ⅙ = 16.667% and $\frac{1}{5.6}$ = 17.8%
		- This is roughly equivalent to 6.1 gigajoules (GJ)
	- It also assumes capacity of 42 gallons per barrel with specific gravity of 38.6 API
- #### Conversion of scf to boe requires assumption of the energy content of 1 barrel to represent how much scf is needed to be equivalent to that
	- this will be further dependant on the scf to btu relationship – that is between volumetric and energy (see [[Areas/General/boe to mmbtu\|boe to mmbtu]])

> [!info]- Crude Oil Equivalent
> - Converting gas volumes to the oil equivalent is customarily done on the basis of the heating content or calorific value of the fuel. There are a number of methodologies in common use.
> - Before aggregating, the gas volumes first must be converted to the same temperature and pressure.
> 	- Common industry gas conversion factors usually range between 1.0 barrel of oil equivalent (boe) = 5.6 thousand standard cubic feet of gas (mscf) to 1.0 boe = 6.0 mscf.
