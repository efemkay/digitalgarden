- #### Mole fraction of a component in a mixture is the value given by dividing the number of moles of a component by the total mole number of a mixture.
	- The value gives how much of a particular component is present in a mixture (the composition of the component by means of moles). Usually, we give this value as a fraction or in one or two decimal places. Since it is a ratio, the mole fraction is unitless.
- #### Weight percent or mass percent is the percentage of the mass of a component in a mixture
	- We call it the **mass fraction** as well. Further, this term describes the ratio between the mass of the desired component and the total mass of the mixture multiplied by 100 to get a percentage value. The formula for this determination is as follows:
	- **Weight** percent **= (mass of the component/total mass of the mixture) x 100**
- #### Key difference is that the mole fraction gives the composition of a substance in a mixture by means of moles, while the weight percent gives by means of mass
	- The difference can be further understood with reference to [[Areas/Petroleum Engineering/a mole of anything contains as many particles as 12g of carbon-12\|a mole of anything contains as many particles as 12g of carbon-12]]
	- Furthermore, the value of mole fraction is given as a fraction or in one or two decimal places while weight percent is given as a percentage value

	- Mole fraction and weight percentage are two different ways of expressing the concentration of a component in a mixture.
