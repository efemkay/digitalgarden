- #### Primary Driver: Technical - Reduce uncertainties on well productivity, its sustainability and reservoir limits, e.g. sand production, hydraulic fracture effectiveness
	- Additional technical data expected to be gain are
		- Static reservoir data
		- Predominantly well performance data
		- Some reservoir performance data
	- EWTs are conducted to determine sustainability of well productivity and reservoir limits. 
- #### EWT is a well test that is run in Exploration or Appraisal wells for longer periods (typically weeks to months) than conventional Production Tests or Drill Stem Tests (DSTs)
	- DST typically run over hours to days. see [[Areas/Public/DST\|DST]]
	- EWT will generally involve only one or two wells. The facilities are fit for purpose to meet the test objectives, and are generally small or minimal compared to EPS and AD. 
- #### EWT’s economics can be evaluated similar to any exploration well analysis, where decision tree and Expected Monetary Value (EMV) is calculated.
	- Probability of success (POS) and failure (1 – POS) are required.
		- see [[Areas/Public/Probability of Geological Success\|Probability of Geological Success]]
	- EWT can contribute early cash flow depending on the testing period and regulatory constraints.
