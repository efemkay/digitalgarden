- #### MB defines the relationship between reservoir pore volume, reservoir pressure, fluid PVT properties and cumulative production/injection
	- It can be imagined like a tank â€“ HC produced will be replaced by other materials. Normally gas cap (if present) will expand to partially replace produced oil vol
		- Gas Cap expansion = $(G-G_{pc}) \cdot B_g - G \cdot B_{gi}$

- #### MB can also be represented in a simpler mathematical equation that expresses the conservation of mass in a reservoir like Havlena-Odeh Method
	- reduces the generalised material balance to a straight line on a plot. `see ss`

- #### There are few useful application in oil and gas, particularly the following
	- [[Projects/Close CG 2022/material balance can determine the Drive Mechanism\|material balance can determine the Drive Mechanism]]
	- To find **original HC In Place**, given the following is available
		- volume of fluids produced
		- average reservoir pressure
		- fluid PVT relationships
	- To find average (a) **reservoir pressure**, and/or (b) **fluid saturations**, given that
		- volume of fluids produced
		- original HC In Place
		- fluid PVT relationship
